This quick start guide should get you up and running in just a few minutes (**without the OpenHIM Core**)

## Prerequisite

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup

Download the [docker-compose.mongo.yaml](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-mediator-mapping/blob/master/docker-compose.mongo.yml) containing the relevant services for the OpenHIM Mediator Mapping service to start successfully

Run the docker compose script by executing the below command

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mongo.yml up -d
```

The docker image will be downloaded and the containers created.

You can see the running docker containers by executing the below command

```sh
docker ps
```

> **NB!** We will need need to configure our mongodb to be a replica set for the OpenHIM Mediator Mapping application to start up successfully. <br />

To configure our MongDB replica set, we need to get inside of the docker container by executing the below

```sh
docker exec -it mapper-mongo-1 mongo
```

Now we can configure our replica set be executing the below command

```sh
config = {
  "_id": "mapper-mongo-set",
  "members": [
    {
      "_id": 0,
      "priority": 1,
      "host": "mapper-mongo-1:27017"
    },
    {
      "_id": 1,
      "priority": 0.5,
      "host": "mapper-mongo-2:27017"
    },
    {
      "_id": 2,
      "priority": 0.5,
      "host": "mapper-mongo-3:27017"
    }
  ]
}

rs.initiate(config)
```

Exit the mongo shell then run the following command to run the Mapping Mediator:

```sh
docker run -e OPENHIM_REGISTER=false -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://mapper-mongo-1:27017,mapper-mongo-2:27017,mapper-mongo-3:27017/mapping-mediator?replicaSet=mapper-mongo-set --network mapper-cluster-network --name mapper -p 3003:3003 -d jembi/openhim-mediator-mapping:latest
```

We can test that the OpenHIM Mediator Mapping application is running successfully by checking its `uptime`

```sh
curl http://localhost:3003/uptime
```

## Test Endpoint

Once all the containers are running, we can proceed to creating some endpoints for the OpenHIM Mediator Mapping to listen on.
